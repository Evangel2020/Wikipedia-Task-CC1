    <h1>THE WIKIPEDIA LIBRARY</h1>
    <h2>FIND SOURCES</h2>
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Independent_sources" target="_blank">Independent </a> and reliable sources are vital for creating encyclopedia articles. Reliable sources allow editors to verify that claims in an article are accurate. The higher the quality of the source for the statement it backs up, the more likely that statement is to be accurate. Independent sources help editors to write neutrally and to prove that the subject has received note. Wherever possible, editors should aim to use sources that are independent and highly reliable for the subjects they write about.

Many of the best sources are not available online, or are only available under subscription. For example, many books are not available online at all, and subscription to academic databases such as JSTOR can be fairly expensive. However, it is possible to use the internet to find many good sources to use in writing encyclopedia articles. Examples of such sources are news stories from newspapers with a reputation for accuracy, books which have previews on Google Books, and academic papers which are available for free on their authors' websites.</p>

    <h3>Types of sources:</h3>
    <p>Many types of sources are available, although some are appropriate only in certain situations.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_publishing#Scholarly_paper" target="_blank">Scholarly article:</a> short papers published in academic journals. They may present original research or review the research of others. Many undergo a process of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_review" target="_blank"> peer review</a> before publication.</li>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book" target="_blank">Book</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monograph" target="_blank">Monograph:</a>  longer academic or popular works.
</li>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textbook" target="_blank">Textbook:</a> an instructional or educational manual covering a particular subject area.</li>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictionary"target="_blank">Dictionaries </a>and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclopedia" target="_blank"> encylopedias</a> reference works containing multiple entries for different words or topics. Wikipedia is an example of an encyclopedia.</li>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archive" target="_blank">Archival</a> and other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_source" target="_blank">primary sources:</a> historic documents.</li>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magazine"  target="_blank">Magazine articles: </a>short papers in popular or trade publications.</li>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics" target="_blank">Statistics:</a> data, particularly census data, and analysis</li>
      <li>Websites, blogs and other user-generated sources: online content from a variety of authors/publishers. Reliability depends on the editorial control of the website. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Self-published_sources" target="_blank">This page</a> discusses issues with user-generated content.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Where to look for sources:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Google or other general search engines are effective for finding online sources in particular, but can also be used for some other kinds of sources depending on the topic area.</li>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Syced/Wikipedia_Reference_Search" target="_blank">User: Syced/Wikipedia Reference Search</a> provides a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Custom_Search" target="_blank">Google custom search</a> that can be used to efficiently find sources on certain websites that some Wikipedia editors have determined are generally reliable, overall. Some hits (such as opinion pages) may not necessarily comply with WP:RS, so judgment is still needed. Because this search only includes returns from a pre-determined list of candidates it could miss many others possible sources. Nonetheless, this tool can sometimes be a good starting point.</li>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Books" target="_blank">Google Book</a>indexes millions of books, both academic and popular; however, not all will be available in full text.</li>
      <li>Public or research libraries have both books and research databases, covering a wide variety of subject areas.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Find_your_library" target="_blank">Find Yours</a></li>
      <li>Bibliographies on a topic outline the main scholarly sources in a subject area and provide a good starting point, where they are available.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Evaluating Sources</h3>
    <p>Issues to consider in deciding whether is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources" target="_blank">reliable </a>include</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Who is the author? What are their qualifications and reputation? Do they have any identifiable biases?</li>
      <li>Who is the publisher? Is the work self-published? Does the publisher have a history of editorial reputation? Does the publisher have any biases?</li>
      <li>When was the source published? Is the information outdated?</li>
      <li>Does the source cite its own sources? Is it based on facts or opinions?
</li>
      <li>Is the source<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research#Primary,_secondary_and_tertiary_sources" target="_blank"> primary, secondary, or tertiary?</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Templates</h3>
    <p>To help find sources, Wikipedians have developed a number of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Source-finding_templates" target="_blank">source-finding templates</a> which link to searches most likely to find references suitable for use in articles.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Find_sources" target="_blank">{{find sources}},</a> an inline template which can be used almost anywhere.(But please don't use it in articles themselves.) This template allows editors to tweak search strings to find the best match for the subject; see the documentation for details. Alternatively, users who desire more freedom can use the meta-template {{find sources multi}}, which allows a choice of search engines. </p>
